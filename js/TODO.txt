ISSUES
  -ma cut ang paragraph both sa about and work sections.
  -make gradient responsive to the scroll in about and work sections.
  -the timeouts are not dynamic(dependent to the animation duration). so that we don't have to wait so 
  long.
  -control the scroll to be dynamic(depends on the content of the paragraph)
TODO
  -make the arrow thinner
  -add circles to the social media icon
  -change images to higher quality.

Opinions
  -I think that the scroll functionality of the paragraphs are needed because of the inconsistency of 
    the height of the browsers.
